This is a simple stock predictor, it will call an API to get raw financial data for a particular ticker, clean the data, calculate a feature value based on the financials, and predict the price based on that feature value. It will then show the model's results in graphical form. 



This is a high-level design and implementation meant to show my understanding of python, the libraries involved (such as pandas, sklearn), and other development topics like APIs.
